# git-started-guide_editable
fork of @wanraitelli gitStarted PDF. Now it is possible to edit guide with Scribus.

Hi. This is vector PDF that is 25 times thiner than original raster PDF (https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines/blob/855a00243db60c71905f6e3afd95ebf2cf7459a0/gitstartedguideoptimized.pdf) by @wanraitelli. I was inspired by her work, but file size  was incredible. Now it's ok! =)

If you want to fix errors or make any other appropriate changes, you can use Scribus (https://www.scribus.net/) and open file "edit_me.sla"
